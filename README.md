# Botte Bot
Doc is outdated, needs overhaul!

## Features
This repository is used to create a Slack bot which can perform various things:
* Insult people
* Check the current weather at a given location
* Define a word you mentioned in a conversation
* Translate sentences
* ... More coming soon!

## Get started (incomplete, does not consider database)
* Install python and pip3.
* Install the requirements.txt file (pip3 install -r requirements.txt).
* Get the necessary API keys and add them to a _init.ini_ file which has to be created inside the config folder.

## To do
* Use user ids instead of nicknames for persisting data.
* Expand food order poll system to a generic poll which users can create (replaced of Polly).
* Further improve visualisation of polls and their results based on feedback.
* Automatic setup of database schema (programatically)
